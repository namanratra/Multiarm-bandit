# Multiarm-bandit

What is a multi-armed bandit test?
The term "multi-armed bandit" comes from a hypothetical experiment where a person must choose between multiple actions (i.e., slot machines, the "one-armed bandits"), each with an unknown payout. The goal is to determine the best or most profitable outcome through a series of choices.

We use 2 techniques ETC (Explore then commit) and UCB (The Upper Confidence Bound) for the problem.
